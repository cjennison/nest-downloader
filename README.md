# Nest Video Downloader

This is a Chrome/Firefox extension that allows you to download Nest video URLs easily that are shared on the web.

I built this out of laziness so I could share family moments over other platforms without rebuilding the video download link.

## Development

1. Zip the directory

```bash
./scripts/zip_dir.sh
```

2. Load the extension in Firefox

```bash
about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
```

3. Click "Load Temporary Add-on"

4. Select the zip file you created in the previous step

5. Click Inspect to see the output
